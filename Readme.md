The PMP exam is based on the <i>PMP Examination Specification</i>,

which describes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_(project_management)">tasks</a> out of five <i>performance domains</i>:
<ol>
 	<li>Initiating the project (13%)</li>
 	<li>Planning the project (24%)</li>
 	<li>Executing the project (31%)</li>
 	<li>Monitoring and controlling the project (25%)</li>
 	<li>Closing the project (7%)</li>
</ol>
The exam consists of 200 multiple choice questions written against the PMBOK specification and the PMP Code of Ethics. The exam is closed book; no reference materials are allowed. Twenty-five of the 200 questions on the exam are "sample" questions used to fine-tune the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_difficulty">degree of difficulty</a> and precision of the exam and as such are not counted for or against a test taker. These questions are placed randomly throughout the exam. The test taker is only graded on their proficiency on 175 questions. The numbers in parentheses describe the percentage of questions for each domain.

<b>Item references</b>

Each exam item (a question with its possible answers) has at least two references to standard books or other sources of project management. Most of the questions reference the PMI <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Guide_to_the_Project_Management_Body_of_Knowledge"><i>A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge</i></a> (<i>aka</i> the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PMBOK">PMBOK</a> Guide).

The Project Management Framework embodies a project life cycle and five major project management <i>Process Groups</i>:
<ol>
 	<li>Initiating.</li>
 	<li>Planning.</li>
 	<li>Executing.</li>
 	<li>Monitoring and Controlling.</li>
 	<li>Closing.</li>
</ol>
encompassing a total of 47 processes.

Mapped to these five process groups are ten project management <i>Knowledge Areas</i>:
<ol>
 	<li>Project Integration Management</li>
 	<li>Project <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(project_management)">Scope</a> Management</li>
 	<li>Project Time Management</li>
 	<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Cost_Management">Project Cost Management</a></li>
 	<li>Project <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_Management">Quality Management</a></li>
 	<li>Project Human <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Management">Resource Management</a></li>
 	<li>Project <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Management">Communications Management</a></li>
 	<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Risk_Management">Project Risk Management</a></li>
 	<li>Project Procurement Management</li>
 	<li>Project <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_Management">Stakeholder Management</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Management_Professional#cite_note-PMBOK_5th_Ed-4">[4]</a></li>
</ol>
The processes of these knowledge areas are described by their inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs. The PMBOK also emphasizes the interaction and interdependence between different process groups. For example, the outputs from one process may be used by one or more other processes as inputs.

<b>Purpose</b>

Government, commercial and other organizations employ PMP certified <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_manager">project managers</a> in an attempt to improve the success rate of projects in all areas of knowledge, by applying a standardized and evolving set of project management principles as contained in PMI's PMBOK Guide.

In December 2005, the PMP credential was number 7 of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZDNet">ZDNet’s</a> <i>10 best IT certifications</i>.

In 2012 the PMP credential was ranked as a top certification by CIO.

In 2015, the PMP credential was ranked as the #4 certification by Global Knowledge, behind 3 Security certifications.

<b>Examination process</b>

An example of a PMP Certificate issued by the PMI to candidates who pass the Project Management Professional Exam.

The global network of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometric">Prometric</a> testing centers provides the PMP exam as a computer-based test. They also offer a paper-based option for locations with no nearby Prometric testing centers. The exam consists of 200 questions ("<i>items</i>"). 25 are pre-release items, which are not included in exam scoring. Prometric calculates the score based on the other 175 items. Each multiple-choice item has one correct answer and three incorrect answers.

Candidates who take the computer-based test receive their results (passed or not passed) immediately upon completion. PMI also evaluates proficiency levels in each project management process group in 4 levels. <i>Above Target</i>, <i>Target</i>, <i>Below Target</i>, and <i>Needs Improvement</i>. Examiners provide these results to the candidate on a score report after the examination. Candidates who take paper-based tests receive their test results and score reports typically within 4 weeks.

Research shows that the most difficult Knowledge areas of the PMP® exam are Quality Management, Integration Management, and Time Management.

<b>Item writing</b>

Item writing is an ongoing process at PMI, and they periodically add new four-choice questions (<i>items</i>) and remove others. Item writers use the <i>PMP Examination Specification</i> to identify item contents and references (project management texts or standards) to verify correctness. Individuals who are active in the field of PMP exam preparation (trainers, courseware developers, book authors, <i>etc.</i>.) may not participate in item writing.

<b>Pre-requisites to become eligible</b>

Candidates must have completed a high school diploma or an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associates_degree">associates degree</a> with 60 months and 7,500 hours of project management experience, or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor%27s_degree">bachelor's degree</a> with 36 months and 4,500 hours of project management experience. In both cases candidates must also have 35 contact hours of project management education. The application for the exam and verification of education and experience are done online at the PMI website. Candidates without the requisite experience can consider <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certified_Associate_in_Project_Management">CAPM, Certified Associate in Project Management</a>, also from PMI.

<b>Continuous credential requirements</b>

Continuous credential requirements are also called CCRs. To maintain the PMP qualification, 60 professional development units (PDUs) must be earned over a three-year cycle, from activities such as researching, authoring articles, speaking on project management-related topics, or being engaged full-time in project management.

Credential holders may earn PDUs towards the maintenance of their credential through formal academic courses or courses offered by a provider (R.E.P. or Component). However, these are only two of the five categories of PDU earning opportunities in which a credential holder may participate.

Effective 1 December 2015, CCRs will be updated to align with the employer-identified skills depicted in the PMI Talent Triangle, a combination of technical, leadership, and strategic and business management expertise, to ensure credential holders are equipped with skills relevant in a continually changing business environment.
